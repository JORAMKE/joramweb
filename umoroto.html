              <h3>What I know about you</h3>
              <p>
                They say that "Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It's not something you learn in school. But if you haven't learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven't learned anything.‚ÄùFor me, I must guess that am a novice and am just being naive.
                <br>I haven't yet learned so you can guess whom I am but as the latter states am just being naive so kindly undestand me. I do acknowledge the fact that shiet may happen but it's all right . I guess everything happens for a reson but from my side I always stand to make sure that I make the best out of me. <br>
               For me I can't say that I know much about you but the little I know is that you are a <i>nice soul.</i> with a warm smile at all times and always in jovial mood. For your other traits I may not be conversant with them.

              <h3>What about valentine</h3>
              <p>
              For me I dont beleive that true love still excists between youths but the good thing is that i dont care.
              Those who would like to fall in love can go on but what I know is that they are just lust-driven and its the situation which forces them to fall in these mare relationships. <br>
              What say that you are only together for satisfying you bodies need s and I second them scientist prove is that the person you are currently dating has a probability of <i>10%</i> of being your future spouse.
              They say that you are only together for satisfying you bodies need s and I second them. <br>
              As yourself <i>after a wedding why do couples go for honey moon</i> initially in the past they used to go for their first time intimacy but now the reason as to why they go is very different. They go just to finish the money which had been conributed for the wedding. Beleive me or not there is no girl below 23yrs who understands the meaning of love.
              <br>What's yor view?
              <br>
              Anyway bestie nikona form ya valentine.

              <h3>Plans and Anticipations</h3>
              <p>
                Have got many plans about how and the things  I would like to accomplish in my life. what worries me most is the fact thaat things do no always go on as anticipated and out of the plans and the dreams that you always have you will only be able to accomplish 50% of them if only you work tirelessly. <br>
                But what I know is that I have done what have got to do in life and everything else is beyond my control and I only have to wait for fate to portray itself. <br>
                But what does the bible say;"seek first the kingdom of God and everything shall be added unto you". What i always hope and remain optimistic for is that one day <i>'Mambo itajipa'</i>
